# LM_Items
 
LM Items is an addon plugin for [Levelled Mobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/levelledmobs.74304/) developed by PenalBuffalo(Stumper66). This fork was specifically developed for the Ultima Kingdoms server.

LM Items enables items from the following plugins to be dropped using a Levelled Mobs loot table:

[Head Database](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/head-database.14280/)  
[MythicMobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%94-mythicmobs-free-version-%E2%96%BAthe-1-custom-mob-creator%E2%97%84.5702/)  
[UltimaAddons](https://github.com/Leomelonseeds/UltimaAddons)

Currently, HeadDatabase and MythicMobs are unused, but they may be useful in the future.
